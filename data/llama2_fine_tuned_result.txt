1441: Taejo issued a decree for the implementation of a new tax system, which replaced the previous one which had been in place during the Goryeo dynasty. This new system was based upon the Chinese method of assessing the value of a person according to their social standing. Those with more social clout were assessed at a higher rate than the lower classes. Each stratum had its own tax rate. This tax code was maintained by the Korean Government until the Treaties of 1910.
