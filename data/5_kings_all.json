    "context": "In 1392, Yi Seong-gye forced King Gongyang to abdicate, exiled him to Wonju, and crowned himself as the new ruler, thus ending Goryeo's 475 years of rule. In 1393, he changed his dynasty's name to Joseon.Among his early achievements was the improvement of relations with the Ming; this had its origin in Taejo's refusal to attack their neighbor in response to raids from Chinese bandits. Shortly after his accession, he sent envoys to inform the court at Nanjing that a dynastic change had taken place. Envoys were also dispatched to Japan, seeking the re-establishment of amicable connections. The mission was successful, and Sh\u014dgun Ashikaga Yoshimitsu was reported to have been favorably impressed by this embassy. Envoys from the Ry\u016bky\u016b Kingdom were received in 1392, 1394 and 1397, as well as from Siam in 1393.In 1394, the new capital was established at Hanseong.When the new dynasty was officially promulgated, the issue of which son would be the heir to the throne was brought up. Although Yi Bang-won, Taejo's fifth son by his first wife Queen Sinui, had contributed the most to his father's rise to power, he harbored a profound hatred against two of Taejo's key allies, Jeong Do-jeon and Nam Eun.\nBoth sides were fully aware of the mutual animosity and felt constantly threatened. When it became clear that Yi Bang-won was the most worthy successor, Jeong Do-jeon used his influence to convince the king that the wisest choice would be the son that he loved most, not the son that he felt was best for the kingdom.\nIn 1392, the eighth son of King Taejo, Yi Bang-seok, was appointed as crown prince. After the sudden death of the queen in 1396 and while Taejo was still in mourning for his wife, Jeong Do-jeon began conspiring to pre-emptively kill Yi Bang-won and his brothers to secure his position in the royal court.In 1398, upon hearing of this plan, Yi Bang-won immediately revolted and raided the palace, killing Jeong Do-jeon, his followers, and the two sons of the late Queen Sindeok. This incident became known as the 'First Strife of Princes'. Aghast at the fact that his sons were willing to kill each other for the throne and psychologically exhausted by the death of his second wife, Taejo immediately named his second son, Yi Bang-gwa, as the new successor and abdicated.\nThereafter, Taejo retired to the Hamhung Royal Villa and maintained distance with his fifth son for the rest of his life.

In 1393, he changed his dynasty's name to Joseon.Among his early achievements was the improvement of relations with the Ming; this had its origin in Taejo's refusal to attack their neighbor in response to raids from Chinese bandits.

After the sudden death of the queen in 1396 and while Taejo was still in mourning for his wife, Jeong Do-jeon began conspiring to pre-emptively kill Yi Bang-won and his brothers to secure his position in the royal court.In 1398, upon hearing of this plan, Yi Bang-won immediately revolted and raided the palace, killing Jeong Do-jeon, his followers, and the two sons of the late Queen Sindeok.

However, some scholars, particularly in North Korea, view Taejo as a mere traitor to the old regime and bourgeois apostate, while paralleling him to General Choe Yeong, a military elite who conservatively served Goryeo to death.\nHis diplomatic successes in securing Korea in the early modern period are notable.",

Furthermore, he performed government ceremonies according to Confucianism, and encouraged people to behave according to the teachings of Confucius.He suppressed Buddhism by banning outside monks from entering Hanseong and reduced the seven schools of Buddhism down to two, Seon and Gyo, drastically decreasing the power and wealth of the religious leaders. One of the key factors in this suppression was Sejong's reform of the land system. This policy resulted in temple lands being seized and redistributed for development, with the monks losing large amounts of economic influence. During the Goryeo dynasty, monks wielded a strong influence in politics and the economy. With the dominant powers of Joseon now being devout Confucianists, Buddhism was considered a false philosophy and the monks were viewed as corrupted by power and money. The Seokbosangjeol, a 24-volume Korean-language translation of Chinese Buddhist texts, was commissioned and published in Sejong's reign by his son Grand Prince Suyang, as an act of mourning for Queen Soheon.\nIn 1427, Sejong also gave a decree against the Huihui community that had held special status and stipends since Yuan dynasty's rule over Goryeo. The Huihui were forced to abandon their headgear, to close down their \"ceremonial hall\" and worship like everyone else. No further mention of Muslims exist during the Joseon era.",

In 1423, under King Sejong\u2019s administration, the government attempted to develop a national currency modeled off of the Tang dynasty's kaiyuan tongbao. The Joseon tongbo was a bronze coin, backed by a silver standard, with 150 coins being equal to 600 grams of silver. Production of the Joseon Tongbo ceased in 1425 because they were too expensive to make, with the exchange rate falling to less than the intrinsic value of the coin.",

The institute was responsible for conducting scientific research with the purpose of advancing the country's technology. The Hall of Worthies was meant to be a collection of Joseon's best and brightest thinkers, with the government offering grants and scholarships to encourage young scholars to attend.Sejong promoted the sciences. He wanted to help farmers so he decided to compile a farmer's handbook. Published in 1429, the book \u2013 Nongsa Jikseol \u2013 dealt with planting, harvesting and soil treatment, and contained information about the different farming techniques that were gathered by scientists from different regions of Korea. These techniques were needed in order to maintain the newly adopted methods of intensive and continuous cultivation.One of his close associates was the great inventor Jang Yeong-sil. As a young person, Jang was a naturally creative and smart thinker. Sejong noticed his skill and immediately called him to his court in Hanseong. Upon giving Jang a government position and funding for his inventions, officials protested, believing a person from the lower classes should not rise to power among nobles. Sejong instead believed he merited support because of his ability. Jang Yeong-sil created new significant designs for water clocks, armillary spheres, and sundials.In 1442, Jang Yeong-sil made one of the world's first standardized rain gauges named cheugugi. This model has not survived, with the oldest existing Korean rain gauge being made in 1770, during the reign of King Yeongjo. According to the Daily Records of the Royal Secretariat, Yeongjo wanted to revive the glorious times of Sejong the Great, and started reading chronicles from that era. When he came across the mention of a rain gauge, Yeongjo ordered a reproduction. Since there is a mark of the Qing dynasty ruler Qianlong, dated 1770, this Korean-designed rain gauge is sometimes misunderstood as having been imported from China.\nIn 1434, Jang Yeong-sil, tasked by King Sejong, invented the gabinja, a new type of printing press. This printing press was said to be twice as fast as the previous model and was composed of copper-zinc and lead-tin alloys.\nSejong also wanted to reform the Korean calendar system, which was at the time based upon the longitude of the Chinese capital. He had his astronomers create a calendar with the Joseon capital of Hanseong as the primary meridian. This new system allowed Joseon astronomers to accurately predict the timing of solar and lunar eclipses.In the realm of traditional Korean medicine, two important treatises were written during his reign.

    "context": "King Sejong profoundly affected Korea's history with the creation and introduction of hangul, the native phonetic writing system for the Korean language. Although it is widely assumed that he ordered the Hall of Worthies to invent the script, contemporary records such as the Veritable Records of King Sejong and Jeong In-ji's preface to the Hunminjeongeum Haerye emphasize that Sejong invented it himself.Before the creation of the new letters, people in the country primarily wrote using Classical Chinese alongside phonetic writing systems based on Chinese script that predated hangul by hundreds of years, including idu, hyangchal, gugyeol, and gakpil. However, due to the fundamental differences between the Korean and Chinese languages, and the large number of characters that needed to be studied, the lower classes, who often lacked the privilege of education, had much difficulty in learning how to write. To assuage this problem, King Sejong created this unique alphabet to promote literacy among the common people. Each consonant letter is based on a simplified diagram of the patterns made by the human speech organs when producing the sound related to the character, while vowels were formed by combinations of dots and lines representing heaven, earth and humanity. Morphemes are built by writing the characters in syllabic blocks. The blocks of letters are then strung together linearly.\nHangul was completed in 1443 and published in 1446 along with a 33-page manual titled Hunminjeongeum, explaining what the letters are as well as the philosophical theories and motives behind them. The manual purported that anyone could learn the alphabet in a matter of days. People previously unfamiliar with it can typically pronounce Korean words accurately after only a few hours of study.\nKing Sejong faced backlash from the noble class as many disapproved of the idea of a common writing system, with some openly opposing its creation. Many within the nobility believed that giving the peasants the ability to read and write would allow them to find and abuse loopholes within the law. Others felt that hangul would threaten their families\u2019 positions in court by creating a larger pool of civil servants. The Joseon elite continued to use the Chinese hanja long after Sejong\u2019s death. Hangul was often treated with contempt by those in power and received criticism in the form of nicknames, including eonmun, amkeul, and ahaekkeul. Despite this, the system gained popularity among women and fiction writers.\nIn 1504, the study and publication of hangul was banned by Yeonsangun. Its spread and preservation can be largely attributed to three main factors: books published for women, its use by Buddhist monks, and the introduction of Christianity in Korea in 1602. Hangul was brought into the mainstream culture in the 16th century, due to a renaissance in literature and poetry. It continued to gain popularity well into the 17th century, and gained wider use after a period of nationalism in the 19th century. In 1849, it was adopted as Korea\u2019s national writing system, and saw its first use in official government documents. After the Treaty of 1910, hangul was outlawed again until the liberation of Korea in 1945.",
